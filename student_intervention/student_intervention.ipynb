    "    - Logistic regression is a common method for binary classification problem. In real world, logistic regression can be used in credit card and loan companies to predict default or no default giving balance and other features. (Gareth et al. \"An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R.\")   \n",
    "    - Strength: simple, fast, provides a probabilistic interpretation, good for small dataset, no multivariant normality and equal dispersion assumptions.  \n",
    "    - Weakness: it assumes a linear decision boundary which might not be the case sometimes; also, parameter estimation can be complicated by multicollinearity in the features.  \n",
    "    - It should work here since this is a binary classification problem with both quantitative and qualititave data.\n",
    "2. Support Vector Machines (SVM)   \n",
    "    - Support vector machine is very powerful and versatile machine learning model, capable of classification, regression and outlier detection. One industrial application of SVM is for mechanical faults diagnostic (Baccarini etc. \"SVM practical industrial application for mechanical faults diagnostic.\") \n",
    "    - Strength: powerful and versatile; can model non-linear decision boundaries with many available kernels; fairly robust against overfitting, especially in high-dimensional space.\n",
    "    - Weakness: it is memory intensive and does not scale well to large dataset; can be tricky to tune\n",
    "    - It could be useful for this problem since we have a classification problem with a relatively small dataset. \n",
    "3. Ensemble Methods (e.g., random forest) \n",
    "    - One example of random forest is in remote sensing-provide land classification (Gislason et al. \"Decision fusion for the classification of urban remote sensing images.\")\n",
    "    - Strength: reduces variance by combining random decision trees with bagging, gives high classification accuracy; it is a good out-of-box model to use, and automatically learns feature interactions\n",
    "    - Weakness: can be computationally expensive, not easy to interpret, needs relatively larger dataset\n",
    "    - It could be a good candidate in this case as the default model usually performs well, and it can avoid overfitting."

The model constructs a decision boundary that separates the classes and also maximizes the distance between the closest members of separate classes. It is just like fitting a widest street between the classes. When we have a new data point (student) we would like to determine which class it belongs to (whether early intervention is needed or not), we simply see which side of the decision boundary it falls given the known features.
